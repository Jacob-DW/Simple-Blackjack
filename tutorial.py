Each player, including the dealer, is dealt two cards. Numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10, and Aces can count as either 1 or 11, depending on what benefits the player most. Players can choose to 'Twist' (take another card) or 'Stick' (keep their current total). If a playerâ€™s total exceeds 21, they bust and lose automatically. After the players finish, the dealer reveals their hidden card and must continue drawing until they reach at least 17. The player wins if they have a higher total than the dealer without busting or if the dealer busts. If both have the same total, the game is a draw. ", font=('Times', 24))
